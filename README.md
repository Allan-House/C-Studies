# C Programming Language Studies

This repository documents my personal journey learning the C programming language. Here is a collection of small programs and practical exercises I've developed to test and consolidate fundamental language concepts. As theoretical foundation, I'm using the book "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan & Ritchie.

## Objective

The objective of this repository is to serve as a record of my progress in learning C, exploring from basic concepts to more advanced language topics.

## Repository Structure

To be developed.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile any program, use:

```bash
gcc -o program program.c
```

To execute:

```bash
./program
```

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Compile a specific program
cd basics/
gcc -o hello hello.c
./hello

# Compile with debug flags
gcc -g -Wall -Wextra -o program program.c
```
